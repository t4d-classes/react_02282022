# Exercise 9

## Requirements

1. Copy the `CarEditRow` component from GitHub and add it to your `components` folder.

1. Add a button labeled "Edit" to the last column of the `CarViewRow` component. When the button is clicked, the row on which it is clicked, changes to a `CarEditRow` component. Only one row is editable at a time. Do not modify a car or the array of cars to change a row from a View Row to an Edit Row.

1. Ensure it works!
